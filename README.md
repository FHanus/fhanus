### Glad to see you here! 

Robotics student 🎓. I enjoy delivering original solutions to real-world problems and working on difficult projects from an idea to the end product 💡. I'm a co-founder of Tribonix, we are creating an affordable upper-body exoskeleton that provides comfort and independence to our users in the medical sector. My focus is on embedded programming, PCB design and machine vision.
