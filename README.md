### Glad to see you here! 

I'm an undergrad robotics student üéì. I enjoy delivering original solutions to real-world problems and working on difficult projects from an idea to the end product üí°. I'm a part of a start-up called Tribonix, we are creating an affordable upper-body exoskeleton that provides comfort and independence to our users. The suit recovers 80% of human arm movements with 7 degrees of freedom üî≠. My focus is on embedded programming, PCB design and machine learning.
